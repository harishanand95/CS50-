1.  an artificial long word that is said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.
2.  16.
3.  Because by having pass by referance you aren't copying anything inside the function,thus saving space.
4.  The for loop through its iteration by taking each character, checks for alphabets and ' characters.It leaves out alphabet sets that are beyond LENGTH and starts reading from the next word.If we find a number as a character, we leave that word. 
5.  The program does removes words that are beyond the LENGTH.So if fscanf is used, we will have to count the total letters again.Taking each character at a time, meant that number if inside a word then that word too can be omitted.  
6.  The parameters word and dictionary, passed can't be changed inside the function.
7.  Data structure used is hashtable.Each element in the hash table consists of a a word and a next pointer to same structure.We compare our given word to hastable's each node's word obtained by a hash function.
8.  0.09
9.  Searched for a good hash function. DJB2 hash function is good for strings,it has a good balance of being extremely fast, while providing a reasonable distribution of hash values. But there are other hash functions which claim to have more better output characteristics, but involves many more lines of code.
10. Bottleneck has to be the fact that this program will take a lot of space.
